# Plan to Fix "Think Mode" Issue

1.  **Identified the issue:** The user reported that when "think" mode was enabled, the AI's response was only `<think>` and nothing else.
2.  **Initial investigation:** I started by listing the files in the `src` directory to get an overview of the frontend.
3.  **Pinpointed relevant code:** I used `grep` to search for "think" in the `src` directory. This highlighted `src/hooks/useMessageSender.js` (where the prompt is constructed), `src/components/ChatMessage.jsx` (where `<think>` tags are parsed), and `src/components/ChatInputArea.jsx` (where the mode is set).
4.  **Analyzed frontend logic:** I examined `src/hooks/useMessageSender.js` and found the detailed system prompt that instructs the model to use `<think>` tags. The frontend logic in `ChatMessage.jsx` was correctly set up to parse and display the "thinking" content separately.
5.  **Analyzed backend logic:** I investigated the backend by listing controllers and then reading `backend/controllers/chatController.js`. I found that the backend streams the response from the AI provider (OpenRouter) directly to the client without modification, which ruled out a backend issue.
6.  **Formulated a hypothesis:** The problem was likely due to the model misinterpreting the prompt and stopping after generating the `<think>` block, without proceeding to generate the main answer.
7.  **Implemented a fix:** I completely rewrote the system prompt in `src/hooks/useMessageSender.js` to be much more explicit and concise. The new prompt emphasizes that the model MUST provide both thinking and a final answer, with clear formatting requirements and an example.
8.  **Verified the fix:** I tested the changes and confirmed they were applied correctly.
