# Chat Initialization Fix

## Problem
The website was opening with a bugged/unavailable chat state where:
- The chat interface appeared disabled
- Users couldn't send messages
- The chat showed an error state

## Root Cause
The issue was in the chat initialization logic where:
1. The app loaded `activeChat` from localStorage without validating if it corresponded to an existing chat
2. If the saved `activeChat` ID didn't match any chat in the `chats` array, `getCurrentChat()` returned `null`
3. This caused the ChatWindow component to show a disabled state

## Solution
Implemented comprehensive fixes across both desktop and mobile apps:

### 1. Enhanced Chat Loading Validation
- Added validation to ensure loaded chats have required properties (`id` and `title`)
- Added validation to ensure `activeChat` corresponds to an existing chat
- Added proper error handling for corrupted localStorage data

### 2. Active Chat Validation
- Added a `useEffect` that validates `activeChat` whenever chats change
- If `activeChat` is invalid but chats exist, automatically set to first chat
- If no chats exist, automatically create a new chat

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Enhanced the ChatWindow component to show a helpful message when no chat is available
- Added a "Refresh Page" button for users to manually reset if needed
- Applied same improvements to mobile chat interface

### 4. Reset Functionality
- Added `resetChats()` function to clear localStorage and start fresh
- Useful for users with corrupted data

## Files Modified
- `src/App.jsx` - Main desktop app chat initialization
- `src/components/mobile/MobileApp.jsx` - Mobile app chat initialization  
- `src/components/ChatWindow.jsx` - Desktop chat window error handling
- `src/components/mobile/MobileChatWindow.jsx` - Mobile chat window error handling

## Testing
Created and ran comprehensive tests to verify:
- Fresh start creates a new chat ✅
- Invalid activeChat falls back to first chat ✅
- Corrupted localStorage data creates a new chat ✅

## Result
The website now opens with a fully functional new chat every time, even if localStorage data is corrupted or invalid. Users will always have a working chat interface available.
