# Tool-Based Features

The AI Portal integrates several specialized tools that extend its core AI interaction capabilities. These tools are designed to assist users with various tasks, from visual brainstorming to complex mathematical computations, and can be accessed directly from the chat interface as modal windows.

## 1. Common Implementation Pattern

Each tool generally follows a similar implementation pattern:

*   **Modal Component:** Each tool has its own dedicated React component (e.g., `WhiteboardModal.jsx`, `EquationEditorModal.jsx`). These components are responsible for rendering the tool's UI and handling its specific logic.
*   **Integration with Chat:** The tools are typically launched from within the chat interface, often triggered by user commands or specific UI elements.
*   **Content Generation:** The primary purpose of these tools is to generate content (e.g., diagrams, equations, 3D models) that can then be inserted into the chat conversation or saved as part of a project.

## 2. Available Tools

### 2.1. Whiteboard

*   **Component:** `WhiteboardModal.jsx`
*   **Description:** A digital drawing canvas that allows users to sketch ideas, create simple diagrams, or visually brainstorm concepts. The output can be saved as an image and shared within the chat.

### 2.2. Equation Editor

*   **Component:** `EquationEditorModal.jsx`
*   **Description:** A LaTeX-based editor for creating and rendering mathematical expressions. Users can input LaTeX syntax, and the editor will display the formatted equation. This is particularly useful for scientific or engineering discussions.

### 2.3. Graphing Calculator

*   **Component:** `GraphingModal.jsx`
*   **Description:** An interactive tool for plotting mathematical functions. Users can input equations, and the calculator will generate a visual representation of the graph, aiding in data analysis and understanding mathematical relationships.

### 2.4. Flowchart Builder

*   **Component:** `FlowchartModal.jsx`
*   **Description:** An interactive tool for creating flowcharts and diagrams. Users can drag and drop shapes, connect them with arrows, and add text to visualize processes, algorithms, or decision trees. This is invaluable for planning and documentation.

### 2.5. 3D Sandbox

*   **Component:** `Sandbox3DModal.jsx`
*   **Description:** A 3D visualization and modeling environment. This tool allows users to create, manipulate, and view 3D objects and scenes. It can be used for prototyping, design, or simply exploring spatial concepts. The output can be rendered as an image or a shareable 3D model representation.

Each of these tools enhances the AI Portal's utility by providing specialized functionalities that complement the core AI interaction, allowing for a more diverse range of tasks to be accomplished within the application.
