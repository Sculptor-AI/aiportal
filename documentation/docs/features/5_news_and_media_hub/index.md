# News & Media Hub

The AI Portal includes a built-in News & Media Hub, providing users with a convenient way to stay updated on various topics directly within the application. This feature functions as an RSS reader, aggregating news from diverse sources.

## 1. Implementation Details

The News & Media Hub is primarily driven by a combination of frontend and backend components.

### Frontend (`NewsPage.jsx`)

The `NewsPage.jsx` component is responsible for rendering the news feed in the user interface. Its responsibilities include:

*   **Displaying Articles:** Presenting aggregated news articles in a readable format.
*   **Category Filtering:** Allowing users to filter news by different categories (e.g., technology, sports, finance).
*   **User Interaction:** Handling user interactions such as clicking on articles to view summaries or external links.

### Backend (`worker.js` - Cloudflare Worker)

The backend logic for fetching and parsing RSS feeds is handled by the active Cloudflare Worker (`worker.js`). This worker acts as a proxy and aggregator, performing the following tasks:

*   **RSS Feed Fetching:** Periodically fetches content from configured RSS feeds.
*   **Content Parsing:** Parses the XML content of RSS feeds to extract article titles, summaries, links, and other metadata.
*   **Data Transformation:** Transforms the parsed data into a format suitable for consumption by the frontend.
*   **API Endpoint:** Exposes an API endpoint that the `NewsPage.jsx` component can call to retrieve the latest news.

## 2. Core Functionality

### 2.1. Aggregated News Display

The hub displays a consolidated feed of articles from various sources, providing a single point of access for news consumption.

### 2.2. Categorization

Articles are categorized, allowing users to focus on specific areas of interest. This helps in navigating a large volume of information efficiently.

### 2.3. Article Summaries

For each article, a brief summary is provided, enabling users to quickly grasp the main points before deciding whether to read the full article (which typically involves navigating to the original source).

## 3. Benefits

*   **Convenience:** Users can access relevant news without leaving the AI Portal application.
*   **Information Discovery:** Helps users discover new articles and sources related to their interests.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** Provides a broader context for AI-related discussions or research by keeping users informed about current events and trends.
