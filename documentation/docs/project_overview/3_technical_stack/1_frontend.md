# Frontend Technical Stack

The frontend of the AI Portal is a modern, single-page application (SPA) designed for a fast, responsive, and feature-rich user experience. It is built using a curated selection of popular and powerful open-source technologies.

## 1. React

[React](https://react.dev/) is the core library used to build the user interface. It allows for the creation of reusable UI components and provides a declarative approach to building complex user interfaces.

## 2. Vite

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a next-generation frontend tooling that provides an extremely fast development server and an optimized build process. It offers:

*   **Hot Module Replacement (HMR):** For instant updates in the browser during development.
*   **Optimized Builds:** Bundles the code for production to ensure fast loading times.

## 3. React Router

[React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) is used for handling client-side routing. It enables the application to have multiple pages and views without requiring a full page reload, which is essential for a smooth user experience in an SPA.

## 4. Styling

The application uses a combination of technologies for styling:

*   **Styled-components:** A popular CSS-in-JS library that allows for writing CSS code directly within JavaScript components.
*   **Standard CSS:** For global styles and theming.

## 5. State Management

To manage the application's state, the AI Portal uses a combination of:

*   **Zustand:** A small, fast, and scalable state management library that is simple to use and provides a clean API.
*   **React Context:** For sharing state between components without having to pass props down through multiple levels of the component tree.
