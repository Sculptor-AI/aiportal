# Backend Technical Stack

The backend of the AI Portal is a robust and scalable API server built with Node.js. It is responsible for handling all communication with the various AI models, managing user data, and providing a secure API for the frontend application.

## 1. Node.js

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is the JavaScript runtime used to build the backend. It allows for building fast and scalable network applications and is well-suited for handling the asynchronous nature of API requests to AI services.

## 2. Express.js

[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications. It is used to:

*   **Define API Routes:** Create the various API endpoints that the frontend application consumes.
*   **Handle HTTP Requests:** Process incoming requests and send back appropriate responses.
*   **Implement Middleware:** Add middleware for tasks like authentication, logging, and error handling.

## 3. Cloudflare Workers

The application is designed to be deployed on the [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) platform. This provides a serverless execution environment that is highly scalable and globally distributed, ensuring low latency for users around the world.

## 4. Database

The application uses a lightweight and serverless database solution:

*   **SQLite:** A self-contained, serverless, and zero-configuration SQL database engine that is ideal for development and small to medium-sized applications.
